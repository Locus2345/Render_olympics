# A very much not real-time renderer, written in python, made to render the olympic rings.
This is a project that I have been wanting to do for a while, and the competition was all the excuse I needed. The main inspirations to do this have been Acerola (https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t) and Sebastian Lague's episode on ray tracing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz0KTGYJtUk).

Although they both have inspired me and given me quite some background knowledge, most concrete concepts I took not from them but from the book <i>Computer Graphics from Scratch: A Programmer's Introduction to 3D Rendering</i> (ISBN-13 978-1718500761), by Gabriel Gambetta.
